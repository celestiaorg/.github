#
# This workflow is used to test the `reusable_dockerfile_pipeline` action used
# to build and push the Docker image to the container registries.
#
# The reason this workflow targets the develop branch is so that we can test the
# action in the PR. If we targeted main, we would need to merge changes into main
# before being able to test them.

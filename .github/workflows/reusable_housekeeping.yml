# This workflow combines and handful of useful housekeeping workflows. Each
# individual step can be enabled by using the corresponding `run-XXX` input
# boolean. Actions are disabled by default so they are opt-in.
#
# NOTE: This workflow requires the `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. Be sure to pass it in
# with the `secrets: inherit` keyword.
#
# labels
# The labels action automates adding labels to issues
#
# projects

#
# auto-request-review
# The auto-request-review action is a helper that is a cross between the
# ownership functionality of the CODEOWNERS and the Github team auto
# assignments.

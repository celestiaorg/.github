# This workflow is an example of a combination of automatic and manual release.
# The triggers are:
#   - Push
#   - Workflow Dispatch
#
# This workflow uses the `if` conditions to control when the CI runs versus when
# a release is also created.
#
# The CI runs when pull requests are created and also when code is merged into
# main, i.e. push events to main.
#
# Lastly, it will trigger from manually workflow dispatches.

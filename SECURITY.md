# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Unless otherwise specified, we recommend to only use the most recent minor version release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning the vulnerability.

To disclose a vulnerability, please submit a `Security Advisory` via the `Security` tab on the impacted repository.

If a repository doesn't have the proper security reporting set up, please email `security@celestia.org` to report the vulnerability.

## Disclosure Policy

Please first submit the vulnerability you discovered using the instructions in
Reporting a Vulnerability. Once you have done so, you may share the details with
third parties after either of the following, whichever is sooner: 
- the vulnerability has been fixed and the Celestia program owner has provided
permission for you to disclose it; or
- you do not receive any response for 120 days after you submit the vulnerability 


### Scope

The scope of this security policy applies to the code repositories under the [Celestia Org Github](https://github.com/celestiaorg) and any related infrastructure.

### Rewards

Celestia Labs has no formal reward policy and researchers should not expect a reward
for discovering a vulnerability. Celestia Labs is nonetheless grateful for all
legitimate discoveries of vulnerabilities, and is happy to acknowledge the
vulnerability and the researchers after a fix has been widely deployed.

### Official Communication Channel

The default communication channel for security related discussions is the `security@celestia.org` email. For security fixes and announcements, the communication channels listed on the [Celestia homepage](https://celestia.org) will be used.

### Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a merge request.

### Expectation

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Extend the Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy;
- Work with you to understand and validate your report, including providing a timely initial response to the submission;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner; and
- Recognize your contribution to improving our security if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change.

### Ground Rules

To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between good-faith hacking and malicious attack, we ask that you:

- Play by the rules. This includes following this policy, as well as any other relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other relevant terms, the terms of this policy will prevail;
- Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the Reporting a Vulnerability steps to report a vulnerability to us, and use only the Official Communication Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;
- Keep the details of any discovered vulnerabilities confidential until they are fixed, according to the Disclosure Policy;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information;
- You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder; and
- Do not engage in extortion.

### Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research in full compliance with this policy and all applicable laws, we consider this research to be:

- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
- Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our Official Communication Channels before going any further.
